TODO LIST:

1. MAKE A LOAD FUNCTION TO GET ITEMS FROM A FILE ON STARTUP
6. MAKE A SAVE FUNCTION TO PUT ITEMS IN A FILE ON PROGRAM TERMINATION
3. AN EASY WAY TO INPUT A TASK ?
4. AN EASY WAY TO INPUT EXECUTABLES WITHOUT NEEDING TO GO FIND THE ABSOLUTE PATH???

COMPLETED TASKS:

2. MAKE A THREAD THAT LOOPS THE TASKS AND RETURNS ONE WHEN ITS TIME TO EXECUTE
5. MAKE THE THREAD/LOOP TO CYCLE THE TASKS




use .json file to save/load AND pass Task information between frontend js code and backend cpp code??
easy way to input a Task could just be retrieving the information in the UI and passing it through the .json
so the backend picks it up by re-reading the save/load file every couple minutes or something
